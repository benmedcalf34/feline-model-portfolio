# DB Design
## Explanation
    I structured the table design for this application in a way that I believe would be straightforward for people to read and understand as well as scale well as more data is added. The business logic I considered was mainly about how can the fewest man hours be wasted bringing someone up to speed on how the tables relate to each other, and which tables should be associated with what data type so as to best reduce bloat as the application is scaled-up. Growth of the database should be handled fairly well with the current design as long as the indices and keys on each table are relevant to the most queried data points, allowing fast queries and low responsetime even as more data is added. The biggest challenge I ran into when designing the DB was how to limit what type of data users can alter. It would not make good business or security sense to allow people to make appointments, be able to add new models, or edit model information without some form of login and verification, so my solution was to design basic tables for user accounts and auth, as well as tables for roles and privileges, so that certain features could be locked to only the privileged users.
