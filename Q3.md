# API Endpoints
## Explanation
    For the API portion of this app, I designed 6 endpoints, 2 each relating to model, users, and appointments. I used Next.js's inbuilt App Router for the writing and structure of the API endpoints. Each type of data point (model, user, and appointment) has its own routing through this API, and although they are not fully implemented, completing them and building more endpoints on top of the pre-existing ones would be straightforward, which is why I structured them as such. Error handling is fairly standard withwrapping each endpoint in a try/catch and returning a detailed error message for easier debugging. For auth, I would opt to use JWT as it offers stateless authentication, which will reduce backend load and server calls which will be beneficial as the application is scaled up. Booking and workflows can be handled by only allowing users to select times when a model is available when requesting an appointment. This can be accomplished by keeping track of what time slots each model is availabale for as well as times that they have already been booked for an appointment. React provides a calendar library, which I have used some basic functionality of in this project, and Next.js can integrate with payment processors such as PayPal or Stripe for payment processing. The biggest challenge I ran into was deciding how to structure the API routing. With Next.js App Router, a single file can make multiple calls, but determining which data each endpoint should access is important. That is why I structured the endpoints as I did, with each associating with a different type of data.
## `create_user`
    Accepts {user, password} in request body, hashes password and adds new user, returns 200 on success
## `verify_user`
    Accepts {user, password} in request body, hashes password and checks credentials against created users, returns 200 on success
## `get_appointments`
    Accepts {modelId} in request body, checks available appointments for requested cmodel, resturns array of appointment objects
## `book_appointment`
    Accepts {modelId, time} in request body, inserts new appointment for the requested model, returns 200 on success
## `get_models`
    Returns all models
## `add_model`
    Accepts {name, breed, color, weight, length, eyeColor, photo} of new model request, returns 200 on success
